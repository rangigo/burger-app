# Burger application made with React/Redux
## Live demo: https://rangigo.github.io/burger-app/
---
In this project, I learn how to use React features, syntaxes and concepts by developing a website to make a burger order.

I take advantage of how the components cycle and structure in React work to make the application dynamic. I also use Redux to manage my website's states so the data flows smoothly

Some additional libraries like axios, react-router-dom are utilized to access HTTP contents and routing my web. Furthermore, I apply CSS modules provided by create-react-app webpack to style my website.

I use Firebase of Google as my backend server to store data and authenticate users.
