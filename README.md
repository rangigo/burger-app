## My first React.js project replicating a simple burger application
---
In this project, I learn how to use React features, syntax and concepts by developing a website to make a burger order.

I take advantage of how the components cycle in React work to make the application dynamic, plus using some additional React libraries like axios, react-router-dom to access HTTP contents and routing my web. Furthermore, I apply CSS modules provided by create-react-app webpack to style my website.

I use Firebase of Google as a temporary database (will try to make my own database using Python in the future!)

How to use:
1) Clone this GitHub project
2) Run "npm install" in the cloned folder
3) Run "npm start" to view the project
